# **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) | Uptime Wizard | Chaos-to-Code Alchemist | Troubleshooting**  
☁️ *Certified AWS Cloud Practitioner | 🐧 Linux LPIC-1 Certified*

## **🛠 Tech Stack**  
- **Infra as Code:** Terraform (cloud's "Ctrl+S"), Ansible (my personal robot butler)  
- **Containers & K8s:** Docker (where everything becomes a neat little box), Kubernetes (the container orchestra conductor)  
- **Monitoring Jedi:** Dynatrace (my crystal ball), Grafana (pretty dashboards), Zabbix (the problem detective)  
- **Languages:** Python (I automate my life), Go (when Python isn't hardcore enough)  

## **🔥 My SRE Superpowers**  
- **SLOs/SLIs:** I know your system's health before you do *(thanks to those certs and 3am debugging sessions)*  
- **Troubleshooting:** I find problems that don't even exist yet (yes, I'm clairvoyant)  
- **Observability:** I make systems so transparent even Scrooge McDuck would approve  

## **🚀 Work Philosophy**  
- "If it's not automated, it's broken" *(Ansible + Terraform certified opinion)*  
- "High uptime, low stress - like AWS EC2 with proper load balancing"  
- "Monitoring is like a good Linux distro: if it’s not yelling at you, something’s wrong"
